#### What it is
An ATTiny85 programmed as an I2C slave, a DS18B20 waterproof temperature probe, and a two-electrode EC probe. It measures conductance and converts it into a temperature-compensated Siemen. From that value, it derives PPM and salinity. It is accurate to ~0.5mS in seawater, and to within ~0.05mS in the hydroponic or freshwater range.

#### Using it
An Arduino-compatible [library](https://github.com/u-fire/ECSalinity) is provided to make using the probe easy and there is extensive [documentation](http://ufire.co/ECSalinity/) on the use and setup of the device.
